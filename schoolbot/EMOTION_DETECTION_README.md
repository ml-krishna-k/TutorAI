# Emotion Detection System - SchoolBot

## Overview

The Emotion Detection System uses Gemini AI to analyze student responses and detect emotional states. It asks 2 questions to students based on their class level and analyzes their answers to determine if they are **HAPPY**, **SAD**, or **DEPRESSED**.

## Features

### üß† Emotional Wellness Check
- **Age-appropriate questions** for each class level (Class 1-12)
- **Gemini AI-powered analysis** of student responses
- **Real-time emotion detection** with visual feedback
- **Supportive messages** based on detected emotions

### üìä Emotion Categories
- **üòä HAPPY**: Positive emotions, enthusiasm, contentment
- **üòî SAD**: Mild negative emotions, disappointment, worry  
- **üò¢ DEPRESSED**: Serious negative emotions, hopelessness, severe distress

## Integration Points

### 1. Class-Based Learning Systems
- **Class 1**: Wonder Valley Learning Adventure
- **Class 5**: Gamified Learning System
- **Class 10**: StudyBuddy Platform
- **JEE/NEET**: Exam Prep Pro Platform

### 2. Frontend Systems
- **Main Dashboard**: NEET & JEE Corner
- **Doubt System**: Ask a Doubt feature

## How It Works

### 1. Question Flow
```
Student enters class ‚Üí Emotion detection starts ‚Üí 2 questions asked ‚Üí Gemini analyzes ‚Üí Result shown ‚Üí Continue learning
```

### 2. Class-Specific Questions

**Class 1-3**: Simple, child-friendly questions
- "How do you feel about your studies today?"
- "What made you happy or sad today?"

**Class 4-6**: More detailed questions
- "How confident do you feel about your studies?"
- "What challenges or successes did you face today?"

**Class 7-9**: Academic focus

**Class 10-12**: Future-oriented questions
- "How do you feel about your board exam preparation?"
- "What's your emotional state regarding your academic goals?"

### 3. AI Analysis Process
1. **Question Collection**: Student answers 2 questions
2. **Gemini Analysis**: AI analyzes response patterns
3. **Emotion Classification**: Categorizes as HAPPY/SAD/DEPRESSED
4. **Result Display**: Shows emotion with supportive message
5. **Continue Learning**: Returns to previous page
